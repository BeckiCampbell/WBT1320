        <p>Tarot is a centuries-old system of divination that combines symbolism and intuition to offer insights into the past, present, and future. Tarot readings are done through a 78-card deck and are usually performed by a skilled practitioner (although one doesn’t have to be a professional to give a tarot reading!). Tarot readers draw and then interpret cards in response to a seeker's questions or concerns.</p>

        <p>The Major Arcana: These 22 cards represent significant life events, lessons, and spiritual themes. Each card depicts a different archetype, such as The Fool, The Magician, The High Priestess, and The World, symbolizing various aspects of the human experience and journey.</p>

            <p>The Minor Arcana: Comprising 56 cards, the Minor Arcana is further divided into four suits—Wands, Cups, Swords, and Pentacles (or Coins in some decks). Each suit corresponds to a different element (fire, water, air, and earth) and represents different aspects of daily life, such as creativity, emotions, challenges, and material matters.</p>
            
            <p>While tarot cards are often used for divination and gaining insight into the past, present, and future, they can also serve as a tool for self-reflection, meditation, and personal growth. Many practitioners use tarot cards to explore their subconscious thoughts and emotions, seeking clarity and guidance in various aspects of their lives.</p>
            
            <p>It's important to note that tarot readings are not definitive predictions of the future but rather a way to tap into one's intuition and inner wisdom. The interpretation of tarot cards can vary widely depending on the reader and the context of the reading, making them a versatile and deeply personal tool for spiritual exploration and introspection.</p>
