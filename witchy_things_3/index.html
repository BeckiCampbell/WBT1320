        <p>Witchcraft” is a word that, for some, may inspire fantastical images of women flying through the night sky on broomsticks and shooting sparks out of a glimmering wand. Others mistakenly associate people who practice Witchcraft with the dark arts—believing that Witches go around hexing people, or use other “black magic” to cause trouble for people they dislike.
        The truth is, Witchcraft is not fantasy, and is not inherently malicious. It’s a vibrant, nature-based spiritual practice that is alive and well in our modern times, just as it has been for longer than we’ve been recording history. </p>
