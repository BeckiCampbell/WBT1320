    <p>The Moon has long been held in reverence by ancient people. Lunar cycles were used as guides for planting and harvesting, celebrations and fertility. In the pagan community it helps guide intentions setting, spell casting and gatherings.  New moons and waxing moons (when the moon grows bigger) are used to grow your fortune, relationships, happiness and health. Full moons are associated with heighten energy, emotions and power, while waning moons (growing smaller) are thought to aid in lessening your burden, be that weight, anxiety, bad relationships or debt. 

    Is Moon Magick real? Ask any nurse or physician who works in an Emergency Department if the full moon makes a difference in the kind of patients they see. Chances are they will tell you that YES, the ER gets crazy busy on full moons.  Coincident? Maybe. Or maybe not.</p>
